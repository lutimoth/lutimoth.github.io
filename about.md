# ABOUT ME

My name is Timothy Lu.
I am a data scientist with an interest in implementing Machine Learning Algorithms for analysis into solving business problems. I love the creativity involved in utilizing data to solve busines problems and creating beautiful visualizations to share those findings.

Currently, this website is being built and will eventually feature my projects. Please stay tuned as I flesh it out and I show my skills in Python, SQL, ML, and data visualization!
